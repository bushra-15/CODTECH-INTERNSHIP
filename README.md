Project Overview: Data Pipeline Development using Pandas & Scikit-Learn:
As part of my Data Science Internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, I completed a project on developing a data pipeline to automate the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. The goal was to build a structured and reusable pipeline for preprocessing raw data into a clean format suitable for machine learning tasks.

Objective:
To create a scalable and automated ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn that handles data preprocessing, transformation, and loading efficiently.

Steps Followed:
1. Data Extraction (E)
Loaded the dataset from a CSV file using Pandas

Verified file structure, data types, and basic stats

2. Data Transformation (T)
Handled Missing Values: Filled or dropped missing entries depending on the column’s importance

Encoding Categorical Features: Used Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding with sklearn.preprocessing

Feature Scaling: Applied StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to normalize numerical columns

Outlier Detection: Identified and optionally removed outliers using IQR or Z-score methods

3. Data Loading (L)
Saved the cleaned and transformed data into a new CSV file using to_csv()

Also enabled conversion to NumPy arrays for machine learning model input

Tools & Libraries Used:
Pandas – for data loading and manipulation

NumPy – for numerical operations

Scikit-Learn – for transformations like encoding and scaling

Matplotlib/Seaborn – for optional EDA and visualization during debugging

Key Features:
Modular code design for reusability

Custom functions for each step in the pipeline

Easy to scale with new datasets

Output-ready data for direct use in ML models

Conclusion:
This project helped me understand the importance of building robust and reusable data pipelines. Automating the ETL process saves time, reduces manual errors, and ensures consistency across data science workflows. It’s a fundamental step in any end-to-end data project.
